# Miffy RabbitMQ AuditLogging

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/survivorbat/miffy-auditlogger)

This is an extension project for the Miffy Framework's RabbitMQ implementation that allows you to replay events stored in
a audit log database. This project consists of a server component hosted in a docker container
and a package to utilise the server in an existing Miffy project.
